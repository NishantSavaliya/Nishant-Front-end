      <p>-> New Components: Bootstrap 5 includes new components like Offcanvas, which provides a flexible and customizable way to create sidebars and modals.</p>
      <p>-> Improved Grid System: While the grid system is fundamentally similar, Bootstrap 5 introduces a more flexible and powerful grid system with additional features.</p>
      <p>-> Customization and Theming: Both versions allow for customization and theming, but Bootstrap 5 has enhanced support for customizing the look and feel of components.</p>
      <p>-> Typography and Icons: Bootstrap 5 includes a new and improved typography system and switches from Glyphicons to SVG icons, providing better scalability.</p>
      <p>-> Documentation: Bootstrap 5 documentation has been improved, providing clearer explanations and examples</p>
      <p>-> jQuery Dependency: Consider whether you want to use a library with or without jQuery. If you prefer a more modern and lightweight stack, Bootstrap 5 might be a better choice.</p>
      <p>-> New Features: Evaluate the new features in Bootstrap 5 and determine if they align with the requirements of your project. If you need the latest components and features, Bootstrap 5 may be the better option.</p>
      <p>-> Community Support: Check community support and third-party libraries. Bootstrap 4 has been widely adopted and has a mature ecosystem. Bootstrap 5 is gaining traction, but community support may vary.</p>
