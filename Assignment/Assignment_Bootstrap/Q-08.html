      <h3>Q-08 : In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?</h3>
      <p>Ans : </p>
      <p>-> In Bootstrap 4, flex box is used to control the layout and alignment specification of Bootstrap 4 components. This box makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structures without using float or positioning attributes.</p>

      <p>-> Bootstrap 4 is built with flexbox, but not every elementâ€™s display has been changed to display: flex as this would add many unnecessary overrides and unexpectedly change key browser behaviors. Most of our components are built with flexbox enabled.</p>
