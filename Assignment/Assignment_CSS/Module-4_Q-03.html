    <h2>Q-03 : What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</h2>
    <p><b>Ans :</b>The difference between CSS2 and CSS3 are...</p>
    <p>-> Unlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle.</p>
    <p>-> With CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast. Earlier, with CSS2, designers could only use “web-safe fonts” for being 100% sure to use fonts that would always display the same on every machine.</p>
    <p>-> While CSS2 had ‘simple selectors’, CSS3 calls the components as ‘a sequence of simple selectors’.</p>
    <p>-> CSS3 has the capability to split text sections into multiple columns so that it can be read like a newspaper. In CSS2, the developers had difficulty because the standard was not equipped with automatically breaking the text so that it fits within a box.</p>
