    <h2>Q-14 :  What is embedded style sheets?</h2>
    <p><b>Ans : </b></p>
    <p>-> when we need to add link of you tube video or map, embedded style sheets use.</p>
    <p>-> This method avoids duplication within a single HTML document. </p>
    <p>-> Every Web page on your site needs this embedded style sheet inserted; consequently any updates to the style sheet have to be made to every HTML document that has the style sheet embedded in it. </p>
