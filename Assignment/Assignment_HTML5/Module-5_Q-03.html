      <h3>Q-03 :  Semantic element in HTML5?</h3>
      <p><b>Ans : </b></p>
      <p>-> HTML was originally created as a markup language to describe documents on the early internet. As the internet grew and was adopted by more people, its needs changed.</p>

      <p>-> Where the internet was originally intended for sharing scientific documents, now people wanted to share other things as well. Very quickly, people started wanting to make the web look nicer.</p>

      <p>-> As the use of visually designed layouts progressed, programmers started to use a generic “non-semantic” tag like &lt;div&gt;. They would often give these elements a class or id attribute to describe their purpose. For example, instead of &lt;header&gt; this was often written as &lt;div class="header"&gt;.</p>

      <p>-> A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to browser and developer.</p>
      <p>-> For Example - </p>
      <pre>
            <li>&lt;header&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;footer&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;main&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;mark&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;detail&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;summary&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;section&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;aside&gt;</li>
      </pre>
