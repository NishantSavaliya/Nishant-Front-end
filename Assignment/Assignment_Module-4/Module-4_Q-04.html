    <h2>Q-04 : Name a few CSS style components.</h2>
    <p><b>Ans :</b></p>
    <p>->Apart from the improved experience for developers, styled-components provides</p>

<p>1. Automatic critical CSS</p>
<p>->  styled-components keeps track of which components are rendered on a page and injects their styles and nothing else, fully automatically. Combined with code splitting, this means your users load the least amount of code necessary.</p>
<br>
<p>2. No class name bugs</p>
<p>-> styled-components generates unique class names for your styles. You never have to worry about duplication, overlap or misspellings</p>
<br>
<p>3. Easier deletion of CSS</p>
<p>-> it can be hard to know whether a class name is used somewhere in your codebase. styled-components makes it obvious, as every bit of styling is tied to a specific component. If the component is unused (which tooling can detect) and gets deleted, all its styles get deleted with it.</p>
<br>
<p>4. Simple dynamic styling</p>
<p>->  adapting the styling of a component based on its props or a global theme is simple and intuitive without having to manually manage dozens of classes.</p>
<br>
<p>5. Painless maintenance</p>
<p>->  you never have to hunt across different files to find the styling affecting your component, so maintenance is a piece of cake no matter how big your codebase is</p>
<br>
<p>6. Automatic vendor prefixing</p>
<p>-> write your CSS to the current standard and let styled-components handle the rest.</p>
