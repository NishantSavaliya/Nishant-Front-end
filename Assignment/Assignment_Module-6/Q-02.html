      <h3>Q-02 :  How many type of Variable in JavaScript?</h3>
      <p><b>Ans : </b></p>
      <p>-> Variables are Containers for Storing Data.</p>
      <pre>-> JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:
              1. Automacally
              2. Using var
              3. Using let
              4. Using const
      <p>-> The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.</p>
      <p>-> The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.</p>
      <pre>For Ex-
            const price1 = 5;
            const price2 = 6;
            let total = price1 + price2;

            The two variables price1 and price2 are declared with the const keyword.

            These are constant values and cannot be changed.

            The variable total is declared with the let keyword.

            The value total can be changed.
