      <h3>Q-10 : What is Condition Statement? </h3>
      <p><b>Ans : </b></p>
      <p>-> Conditional statements allow us to represent such decision making in JavaScript, from the choice that must be made (for example, "one cookie or two"), to the resulting outcome of those choices (perhaps the outcome of "ate one cookie" might be "still felt hungry", and the outcome of "ate two cookies" might be "felt full, but mom scolded me for eating all the cookies".)</p>
      <p>-> Let's look at by far the most common type of conditional statement you'll use in JavaScript — the humble if...else statement.</p>
      <p>-> Basic if...else syntax looks like this:</p>
      <pre>
            if (condition) {
             /* code to run if condition is true */
            } else {
             /* run some other code instead */
            }
      </pre>
      <p>-> This code is pretty human-readable — it is saying "if the condition returns true, run code A, else run code B"</p>
