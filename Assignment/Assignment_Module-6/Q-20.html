      <h3>Q-20 :  What is the difference between && and || in JavaScript?</h3>
      <p><b>Ans : </b></p>
      <p>And (&&)</p>
      <p>-> The logical AND (&&) (logical conjunction) operator for a set of boolean operands will be true if and only if all the operands are true. Otherwise it will be false.</p>
      <br>
      <p>or(||)</p>
      <p>-> The logical OR (||) (logical disjunction) operator for a set of operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true. It is typically used with boolean (logical) values. When it is, it returns a Boolean value. However, the || operator actually returns the value of one of the specified operands, so if this operator is used with non-Boolean values, it will return a non-Boolean value.</p>
