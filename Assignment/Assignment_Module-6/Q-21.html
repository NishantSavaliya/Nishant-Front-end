      <h3>Q-21 : What is the use of Void (0)?</h3>
      <p><b>Ans : </b></p>
      <p>-> This operator allows evaluating expressions that produce a value into places where an expression that evaluates to undefined is desired.</p>
      <p>-> The void operator is often used merely to obtain the undefined primitive value, usually using void(0) (which is equivalent to void 0). In these cases, the global variable undefined can be used.</p>
