      <h3>Q-05 : What the deference between undefined and undeclare in JavaScript?</h3>
      <p><b>Ans : </b></p>
      <p>-> Undefined: It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. Undefined is not a keyword.</p>
      <p>-> Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using the var or const keyword.</p>
