      <h3>Q-20 :  What is the difference between && and || in JavaScript?</h3>
      <p><b>Ans : </b></p>
      <p>And (&&)</p>
      <p>-> The logical AND (&&) (logical conjunction) operator for a set of boolean operands will be true if and only if all the operands are true. Otherwise it will be false.</p>
      <p>-> For Example : </p>

      <script>
            let a = 5;
            let b = 3;
            let c = 7;

            console.log(a > b && b < c); //true - both condition is true

            console.log(b < a && c < a); //false- one condition is true and one is false
      </script>

      <br>
      <p>or(||)</p>
      <p>-> The logical OR (||) (logical disjunction) operator for a set of operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true. It is typically used with boolean (logical) values. When it is, it returns a Boolean value. However, the || operator actually returns the value of one of the specified operands, so if this operator is used with non-Boolean values, it will return a non-Boolean value.</p>

      <p>-> For Example : </p>

      <script>
            a = 5;
            b = 3;
            c = 7;

            console.log(a > b || a > c); // true - one condition is true.

            console.log(b>a || b>c); // false - both condition is false.
      </script>
