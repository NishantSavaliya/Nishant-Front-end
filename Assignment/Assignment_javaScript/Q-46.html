      <h3>Q-46 : Write a JavaScript program to clone an array? </h3>
      <p><b>Ans : </b></p>
      <p>-> In JavaScript, cloning an array means creating a new array with the same elements as the original array. Cloning an array in JavaScript is useful when you want to create a new array that has the same elements as an existing array, without modifying the original array.</p>
      <script>
            let originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
            let clonedArray = Array.from(originalArray);
            console.log(clonedArray);
      </script>
