      <h3>Q-47 : What is the drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects? </h3>
      <p><b>Ans : </b></p>
      <p>-> <b>Performance:</b>Declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects
            can lead to performance problems, especially if the object is
            instantiated many times. This is because each time the object is
            instantiated, a new copy of the method is created.</p>

      <p>-> <b>Readability:</b>Declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects
            can make the code more difficult to read and maintain. This is because
            the methods are not grouped together in a logical way.</p>

      <p>-> Reusability:</b>Declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects
            can make it difficult to reuse the methods in other objects. This is
            because the methods are not defined in a central location.</p>
