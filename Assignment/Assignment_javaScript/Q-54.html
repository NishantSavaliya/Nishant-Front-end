      <p><b>Ans :</b></p>
      <pre>Go to any popular site with a registration form, and you will notice that they provide feedback when you don't enter your data in the format they are expecting. You'll get messages such as:

           * "This field is required" (You can't leave this field blank).

           * "Please enter your phone number in the format xxx-xxxx" (A specific data format is required for it to be considered valid).

           * "Please enter a valid email address" (the data you entered is not in the right format).

           * "Your password needs to be between 8 and 30 characters long and contain one uppercase letter, one symbol, and a number." (A very specific data format is required for your data).
