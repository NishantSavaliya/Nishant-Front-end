      <h3>Q-67-07 : What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</h3>
      <p>Ans : </p>
      <p>-> View state can only be visible from a single page and not multiple pages. Session state value availability is across all pages available in a user session</p>

      <pre>
            
            * SessionState

            -> Can be persisted in memory, which makes it a fast solution. Which means state cannot be shared in the Web Farm/Web Garden.
            -> Can be persisted in a Database, useful for Web Farms / Web Gardens.
            -> Is Cleared when the session dies - usually after 20min of inactivity.

            * ViewState
            
            -> Is sent back and forth between the server and client, taking up bandwidth.
            -> Has no expiration date.
            -> Is useful in a Web Farm / Web Garden
