      <h3>Q-67-13 :  What is the function of the delete operator?</h3>
      <p>-> The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property's value is an object and there are no more references to the object, the object held by that property is eventually released automatically.
      </p>
      <p>-> for Example :-</p>
      <script>
            const Detail = {
                  firstname: 'Nishant',
                  Age : '25 yr',

            };

            console.log(Detail.firstname);
            console.log(Detail.Age);
            //  output: "Nishant"
            //  output: "25 yr"

            delete Detail.Age;

            console.log(Detail.Age);
            //  output: undefined
      </script>
