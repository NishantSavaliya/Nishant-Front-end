      what is form-handeling in react js ?
      using form take data or submit data using form there we applied event handeling and submited that form via form handeling. 

      examples : onsubmit | onChange | onclick

      There are two types of components used in Form handeling
      a)controlled component
      examples : controlled components access its state properties using useState hook access that is called controlled components
            import React,{useState} from 'react' 
      
      b)uncontrolled component
      
      uncontrolled component is used to access user input data using ref attributes and useRef hook to access user information via form there we used uncontrolled component.
                  import React,{useRef} from 'react'


      Note : hook is a simple used as module or function of React js that is used to access user data | fetch user data | access state properties etc.
